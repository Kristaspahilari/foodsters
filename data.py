    "Short Description": " Chopped salad with perfectly cooked cold long grain rice mixed with homemade olive oil, lemon, herb and garlic dressing. ",
    "Long Description": "Rinse the rice first, until the water runs clear to remove starch. Put the drained rice and the correct amount of water into a pan, bring to the boil. Once boiling, place the lid on and time for 8 minutes. Do not lift the lid the rice will cook perfectly in this time and will not need stirring! After 8 minutes, turn the heat off and leave the lid on for 2 minutes. Finally use a fork to fluff up the grains. Transfer to a bowl and place in the fridge to help it cool down quicker while you prepare the rest of your salad!"
